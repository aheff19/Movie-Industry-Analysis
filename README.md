# Movie-Industry-Analysis
An analysis of the movie industry for prospective business stakeholders.

## Goals
Microsoft has asked us to give a presentation on how to get started in the movie business.  

To that end, in this study we will answer the following:
* What is the highest grossing genre on average?
* How much should the you spend on a film production? How have budgets changed over the years?
* What time of the year is it most profitable to release a movie?

### Data Sets and Resources:
We used API's from the following databases:
* Box Office Mojo
* IMDB
* Rotten Tomatoes
* TheMovieDB.org

## What is the highest grossing genre on average?
### Initial impressions
With the popularity of frachises such as the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Star Wars,
it goes without saying that the "Adventure" genre is pretty popular, but what are some other popular genres?

### Findings and Conclusions

There we have it! Adventure is the most profitible genre with animation not far behind it. Documentaries, despite being popular on Netflix, just don't sell well at the box office. This is probably a result it having a niche audience. One caveat about our analysis is that it is too linear. This implies that each movie only falls under a single genre. This is rarely the case, however, since most movies fall into multiple genres.

### Recommendations

For now, it is safe to say that you should create an adventure film, but it would be worth looking into what combination of genres will yield the most profit (e.g., Adventure, Animation, and Fantasty, or Romantic-Comedy/Fantasy).

## How much should the you spend on a film production? How have budgets changed over the years?

### Initial Thoughts 

Initially, we thought that the median budget for a film was around $50 million.  Considering big budget films like Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets had a budget of $100 million (TheNumbers), $50 million seems like a modest amount.

### Findings and Conclusions

Well, we were off by a few million! Thanks to advent of modern technology, such as, visual studio effects, CGI, etc, budgets have decreased. 30 years ago, that extra expenditure  would have gone towards, car explosions, pyrotechnics, and stuntmen.  However, we do see that, even during the recession in the 2000's, there is a slow but steady increase in the amount of money spent on the production budget.

### Recommendation

Currently we recommend the budget be set to $38 million, as our studies have concluded to the be the median amount spent.  We also want you to keep in kind that the budget, according to the market trend, will continue to rise as demands for spectacle increase.
